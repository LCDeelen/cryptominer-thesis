# Abstract
Cryptomining malware takes up significant resources and computing power, with protection meth-ods either focusing on behavioral analysis on individual systems or static network traffic signatures.This thesis aimed to find a network based solution that used behavioral statistics of miners for de-tection.  A custom malware lab was created to perform controlled data collection of network trafficfrom cryptominer samples.  Next, an automated pipeline was built to label the data and generatestatistical features from the observed traffic.  To explore for solutions, the data was scaled and cor-related using a variety of methods for feature selection, resulting in fifteen mutations of the data.Finally, six different machine learning classifiers were trained on ranges of parameters to find theoptimal tuning, resulting in a total of ninety combinations of classifiers and data mutations.  TheNaive Bayes worked best, minimizing false negatives with a recall score of 98.11% but a precisionof only 19.55%.  The potential for an improved system is shown without retraining the classifiers,that is already capable of increasing the precision to 99.69%, but lowers recall to 50.40%.
